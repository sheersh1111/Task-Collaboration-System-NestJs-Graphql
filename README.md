# About project
  This project is based creating new porjects and tasks in those projects. Another user can collaborate on those tasks within his access control rights. For example - If he has been given right to create new tasks in project 1 then he can create new tasks inside that project.

  Comments are also available for each task. 
  If someone is assigned a task he will get notified about it and also when someone comments on task in which he is associated.

# Technicality of the project
  I was asked to indpendently chose the idea based on time provided in hiring assignment test. So I came up with this medium level complexity tasks. Which uses -
  1. NestJs.
  2. Graphql
  3. Comprises of different modules like users,projects,tasks,comments,uac(user access control),notification gateways,auth and cache.
  4. I have used guards for handling access controls(example of dependency injection).
  5. Also used factory pattern to derive a hibrid guard which changes depending on parameter provided.
  6. Made use of Adaptor pattern for sending grphql data back without it's generalized errors using DTO's.
  7. Made use of Notifications gateway and implemented it through new instances in each resolver constructor(A good example of Single Responsibility Proinciple).
  8. Similarly, I have built my own Cache module on top of Cache Module of redis and nestjs and used it by making new instances in each resolver constructor(This also is a good exmaple of Single Responsibility Principle).

# Steps to run
  Turn on docker and 
  Run `docker-compose up --build`
  Test on localhost:3000 port for testing API's and websockets.

# Link to postman documentation of API's 
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21465485/2sAYBYfVuU

# Images for Socket.io connection for notifications

![received-task](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33db8b55-61ce-4f97-9dbc-76d857b19226)

In case of websocket I am mapping auth token with client socket ID so you will need token in params and event listener of notification in your testing tool.Just like shown in above images.
